Design of a Digitally Tunable 5th order gm-C low pass filter :In This recent project, I designed a 5th-order gm-C low pass filter using CMOS 180nm technology, specifically tailored for wireless applications. This filter boasts a wide tuning range of 6-40 MHz, which is controlled by a single bias current, making it highly adaptable for various uses. To enhance the precision of the filter, I incorporated identical Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTAs) and a 5-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter, allowing for meticulous adjustments of the cut-off frequency. The development of this model was driven by the dynamic requirements of wireless and IoT applications, with a strong focus on ensuring both adaptability and high precision within its design framewor
