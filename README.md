# Academic-project 1:Design of a Digitally Tunable 5th order gm-C low pass filter 
In This recent project, I designed a 5th-order gm-C low pass filter using CMOS 180nm technology, specifically tailored for wireless applications. This filter boasts a wide tuning range of 6-40 MHz, which is controlled by a single bias current, making it highly adaptable for various uses. To enhance the precision of the filter, I incorporated identical Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTAs) and a 5-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter, allowing for meticulous adjustments of the cut-off frequency. The development of this model was driven by the dynamic requirements of wireless and IoT applications, with a strong focus on ensuring both adaptability and high precision within its design framewor                    
# Academic-project 2:Efficient 915MHz RF Energy Harvesting for IoT Applications                       
In my recent project, I developed a 915MHz RF Energy Harvesting (RFEH) system using TSMC65 technology in the Cadence Virtuoso platform, focusing on improving efficiency and power dynamic range for IoT applications. The project explored the utilization of multiband frequency bands in energy harvesting circuits, with an innovative approach of integrating both Ï€ and L matching networks to enhance overall performance and efficiency.
